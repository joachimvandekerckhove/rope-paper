# Switch Rates and Underweighting 
#### *Kevin W. Soo & Benjamin M. Rottman*

This folder contains data and analysis scripts used in the manuscript *Switch Rates Do Not Influence Underweighting in Decisions from Experience, 
but Optional Stopping Does* by the authors (currently under review). The manuscript reports four studies attempting to replicate findings by Hills & Hertwig (2010) showing that switch rates during sampling predict underweighting and use of particular decision policies.

* To replicate the analyses in our manuscript, open the individual files in the *R* folder.
* Each script reads data from the *Datasets* folder.
* Each script runs a particular analysis and prints either the output or graphs used in the manuscript.
